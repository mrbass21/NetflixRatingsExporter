# Introduction

The purpose of this project is, primarily, for me to learn Rust. It also happens that I love Netflix and hate the new
ratings system, and wanted a way to backup my own ratings.

This also serves as my first github project that's public, so I expect the history to be pretty... messy.

# Status

This project is NOT done or functionally operational. Everything I have committed so far will build, but no real functionality is there, yet.
